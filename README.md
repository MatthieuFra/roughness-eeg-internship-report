# Roughness, ASSRs and two EEG device, experiment and report


 This repository is meant to be an online ressource for my M1 internship report, in the Neuroscience Major of the Cogmaster at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure, Paris.

#### Author : Matthieu Fraticelli - 2023

## The Goal 

This repository contains supplementary data, but also host an online version of the report, written using Obsidian in Markdown, and displayed using GitHub pages. 

## Structure 

- In Writing, you will find the report, both in PDF and in Mardown format. 

- In Code, you will find all the code of the experiment for which I made explicit reference in the report. 

- In Data, you will find other content, such as the sound stimuli used, and other images that are used in the online version of the report.
