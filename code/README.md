# Code


Here you will find all the code of the experiment for which I made explicit reference in the report. 

- In Analysis are the python scripts used to analyze the data, using MNE-Python and others libraries.
- In Creating_stimuli, the MatLab code used to create the clicktrains.
- In Experiment, the PyschoPy experiment.
